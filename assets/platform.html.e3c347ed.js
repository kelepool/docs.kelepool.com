Generally speaking, the platform will show the terms that need to be clarified during the signing process. If you don&#39;t see or check any terms when staking, be careful.</p><ol start="3"><li>Staking mode</li></ol><p>Cryptocurrency staking has existed for several years, and now a variety of staking pool services have been developed. From the perspective of the platform, there are mainly two types: centralized platforms and decentralized ones. The services provided by centralized exchanges require custody of funds, saving a lot of tedious operations for users, but from a security point of view, users need to bear latent risks such as fund abuse and market manipulation, so we will not discuss this model in this article. While decentralized platforms do not host funds, and are generally distinguished by private key custody methods. The current main application models are divided into liquid staking and smart contracts.</p><p>Liquid staking allows the platform to directly host your private keys, and you will get some new tokens (your tokenized funds) that can be used for trading or as collateral for DeFi activities. Because the staked coins cannot be used during the regular staking process, so in an ideal state, liquid staking enables you to more freely control the staked assets by trading tokenized funds.</p><p>But this model has two main drawbacks. One is that the platform has the user&#39;s private key, which has certain security risks; the other is that the new tokens you get are not very stable in value. They are expected to remain consistent with the value of the corresponding funds, to be more specific, they need to exchange 1:1 with the staked funds. However, this is hard to achieve in actual operation, and the exchange ratio will fluctuate more or less. Also, if a token is not recognized in the market you want to trade, its liquidity is meaningless.</p><p>Speaking of the second mode - smart contract, it is a simpler and more transparent way of staking, and it is also the solution currently adopted by Kele Pool. Smart contracts allow users to host their private keys to the contract instead of the platform. These technical means make the important information of the transaction in the hands of an absolutely safe and impartial third party, and the platform only provides services and cannot operate the private key. In order to let everyone better understand, let&#39;s take the contract of Kele Pool as an example to explain it.</p><h1 id="kele-pool-smart-contract" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kele-pool-smart-contract" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Kele Pool Smart Contract</h1>',9),x=t("The ETH network requires at least 32ETH to create a new validator.
