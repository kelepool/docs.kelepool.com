* Select a subaccount, click "Overview" on the left menu to enter the page, and check the hashrate and worker information.&#x20;
* The 24-hour hashrate is generally displayed the next day.&#x20;
* Worker: The active worker has the share submitted within 10 minutes. The inactive worker doesn't have the share submitted within 10 minutes but 10 minutes to 24 hours before the current time.&#x20;
* The hashrate chart supports viewing the trend of hashrate by hour, day, and month. When the hashrate is small, the fluctuation of the curve in the hourly view will be larger.&#x20;
* Network Status: The currency's entire network hashrate, difficulty and estimated rewards.&#x20;
* Click the "Mining" menu to view the data of each worker, and you can check the real-time hashrate, daily hashrate, and rejection rate of the worker.
