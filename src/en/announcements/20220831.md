ETC uses the Etchash algorithm and is compatible with ETH mining equipment (ASIC miner needs to upgrade the firmware). ETC is the most influential and recognized PoW fork in the history of ETH. At present, ETH is expected to end PoW mining in mid-September, and the supporters of ETC have increased accordingly.

Kele Pool supports the mining of multiple currencies including ETC, and will continue to provide you with stable and secure mining services.
