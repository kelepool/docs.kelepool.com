# How to use smart contract to stake?

## 1.Introduction

The two main functions of the contract are large pledge and small pledge. Developers can use javascript to call the contract of the cola mining pool for pledge. The contract adopts the upgradeable scheme of the open source project [Openzeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts), so `be sure to call the proxy contract To stake `, the logic contract will be updated and replaced when ETH2.0 is launched or the function changes.

## 2.Install libraries

We need to use an ETH library: `ethers`, `web3.js`, you can choose any of them, here we choose `ethers` to call the contract of the cola mining pool, below we take `Javascript` as an example to call `Metamask Wallet` implements cola mining pool staking.

``` bash
npm install --save ethers
```

## 3.Get contract ABI

The following is the ABI data of the cola mining pool ETH pledge contract. This data is required when calling the contract later. It is essentially a JSON string. This data can be viewed on `Etherscan` [Logical Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b27417d971d6aec8a8406143c507095f729bff0#code) can also get:

``` json

## 4.Stake ï¼œ 32 ETH
Users can pledge a minimum of 0.01ETH and a maximum amount of ETH. When the total amount of small pledges in the contract exceeds 32ETH, the Kele Pool will use the [Ethereum official CLI tool](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) generates withdrawal credentials in the cold wallet and automatically creates a verification node. The user's funds are managed and secured by the cola mining pool. After the official launch of ETH2.0 in the future, the cola mining pool will open the withdrawal interface for users.

- Small staking is as simple as depositing tokens into the Kele Pool smart contract
- Suppose we intend to pledge `125.0172ETH`, after the pledge, Kele Pool will immediately create `3 validating nodes` (32ETH each)
- The remaining `29.0172ETH` in the contract will be pledged, and a verification node will be created after other users pledge enough `32ETH`

``` javascript

// import libraries
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// connect metamask
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
let userAddress = await signer.getAddress();

// initialize
const kelepool = {
  address: "0xACBA4cFE7F30E64dA787c6Dc7Dc34f623570e758",// The proxy contract of kelepool
  abi: [{"anonymous":false....ã€€}] // contract abi
};
const contract = new ethers.Contract(kelepool.address, kelepool.abi, signer);

// execute small staking, at least 0.01ETH, we staking 125.0172ETH
let amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("125.0172", 'ether')
const tx = await contract.deposit({
    from: userAddress, // user wallet address
    value: amount,// staking amount
    gasLimit: 10000000 // max gas limit
});
console.log(`transition hash: ${tx.hash}`);


```

## 5.Stake â‰¥ 32 ETH
The user needs to pledge at least 32ETH, and the maximum can be pledged 3200ETH (depending on the gas situation). The amount of each pledge must be an integer multiple of 32+fee. The fee is currently 0.05ETH, and the cola mining pool will charge the fee as the node operation fee.

Large-amount pledge is mainly divided into three steps:

- Generate withdrawal credentials
- Generate validator public key
- Execute large stakes

### ï¼ˆ1ï¼‰Generate withdrawal credentials

Large staking requires users to use [Ethereum official CLI tool](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) to generate withdrawal vouchers. The tool will generate two files, `deposit_*.json` or `keystore-*.json`. Users must save their own mnemonic phrases. With the mnemonic phrases, these two files can be regenerated at any time.

Kele Pool only needs the value of the `withdrawal_credentials` attribute in the `deposit_*.json` file, which will be used as the ETH2.0 withdrawal certificate. The generated related tutorials can be viewed [here](https://kelepool.gitbook.io/help-center-zh/pos/FAQ/eth-deposit-cli) or [here](https://hackmd.io/urta4YBdTrqSaNqiHgP7Cw ).

Below is an example of the deposit_*.json we generated with the official Ethereum CLI tool:

```json
[
    {
        "pubkey":"aa382e5b26eb8a73a305471adcf6e5188835717c31f3e12e5964028216465ce53a33c4f8ff5d28d4d047f4a77c49d349",

        "deposit_message_root":"b771a2be82e825dd7a3df7732e72ab0f4a89d85e62c802651f01d12c08f98a9e",
        "deposit_data_root":"e43a0337b5e485a7bb4ad50969c54c88fc5756a1b6502b6499d16fcd2f30b061",
        "fork_version":"80000069",
        "network_name":"ropsten",
        "deposit_cli_version":"2.2.0"
    }
]
```

### ï¼ˆ2ï¼‰Generate validator public key
The validator's public key is mainly used for the cola mining pool to run the ETH2.0 node. In order to prevent the same validator from running in different places and causing penalties, the cola mining pool will create the validator's public key according to the user's withdrawal certificate.

After getting the `withdrawal_credentials` attribute value in the `deposit_*.json` file from the previous step, we can request the API of the cola mining pool to generate the public key of the verification node.

### ï¼ˆ3ï¼‰Execute large stakes
After obtaining the public key of the validator obtained above, we can make a large pledge. First, we still need to write the basic wallet operation code according to the small pledge example.

The difference from the small pledge is that there are more parameters passed in, and we also need to assemble the data during batch pledge. First, we need to loop the validator public key array returned by the above API, concatenate the `pubkey`, `signature` and `deposit_data_root` strings in the array, and assemble the parameters according to the contract ABI interface.

- Suppose we want to pledge 96ETH and get `96 / 32 = 3`, then we need to prepare an additional fee of `0.05 * 3 = 0.15ETH`
- Cola Mining Pool charges a fee for each verification node. The validity period of the operating fee is when ETH2.0 goes online. After that, Cola Mining Pool will charge according to the situation.
```javascript


// import libraries
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// connect metamask
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
let userAddress = await signer.getAddress();

// initialize
const kelepool = {
  address: "0xACBA4cFE7F30E64dA787c6Dc7Dc34f623570e758",// // The proxy contract of kelepool
  abi: [{"anonymous":false....ã€€}] // Contract ABI
};
const contract = new ethers.Contract(kelepool.address, kelepool.abi, signer);


// Assemble large pledge data
let data = [] // The data object returned by the API
let stakingPublicKey = ''
let stakingSignature = ''
let stakingCredentials = '001ae74d19004b360d02d411795cee1451dc20679f13a13aafce7de2448b60cb' // user withdrawal credentials
let stakingRoot = []
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    let validator = data[i]
    stakingPublicKey += validator.pubkey // Concatenate the public key string
    stakingSignature += validator.signature // Concatenate the signature string
    stakingRoot.push('0x' + validator.deposit_data_root) // Concatenate the deposit_data_root string
}

// convert data
let prefix = '0x'
let pubkey = ethers.utils.arrayify(prefix + stakingPublicKey)
let withdrawal_credentials = ethers.utils.arrayify(prefix + stakingCredentials)
let signature = ethers.utils.arrayify(prefix + stakingSignature)
let deposit_data_root = stakingRoot
// execure large staking, at least 32ETH,we staking 96ETH here, it needs 0.05ETH fee for every validator,so we have to add more 0.15ETH for kelepool fee.
let amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits('96.15', 'ether')
const tx = await contract.createValidator(1, pubkey, withdrawal_credentials, signature, deposit_data_root, {
    from: userAddress, // user wallet address
    value: amount,// staking amount
    gasLimit: 10000000 // max gas limit
})
console.log(`transaction id: ${tx.hash}`);


```
